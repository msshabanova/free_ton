# Tokens fungible smart contracts

Tokens fungible contracts implementation with burn support + tests.

## Configuration

Set up FreeTON configuration in `env/` directory. Use `template` files as a basic example and fill the empty fields. 

### Free TON

FreeTON env configuration will probably change, keep your eyes on.

- Use `NETWORK` http://ton_node in case you're using Docker compose
- Use `SEED` to generate keys. Seed can be generated with `tonos-cli genphrase`
- Leave `RANDOM_TRUFFLE_NONCE` blank if you need to determine contract address. Means, that test can be run only once. Set it `1` to deploy new addresses each time.
